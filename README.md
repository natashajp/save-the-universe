# save-the-universe

This is a very basic player vs. alien invasion game made for a class in which the player ship is engaging six alien ships.  

How to play: This is a console game with a DOM button, so inspect the page and go to the built in browser console to see the game play out.
Press the fire button to shoot at an alien ship. Move your mouse away from the fire button for the alien ship to engage your ship.
When all six ships are destroyed, you win!

Improvements I would/might make: 
When the alien ships are destroyed, ideally the attackPlayer() method would not be able to be called anymore, removing the error that
comes up after the player wins.
More HTML and CSS styling.
Move the game from the console to the browser window.
